# Asteroid Protetector

My version of asteroid made with bevy and rapier_2d created to better learn rust and bevy.

## The Concept
The player is controlling a spaceship orbiting around it's homeplanet trying to deflect incoming asteroids. The player can cotrol the thrust of the spaceship, to change it's orbit trajectory, and its orientation to aim and shoot at the incoming asteroids. At this point in development the objective is to protect the planet and yourself as long as possible. I think adding the orbiting mechanics will make the game more challenging and more like a "action puzlle" than a pure action game.

## Control Scheme

| A     | Counterclockwise rotation |
|-------|---------------------------|
| D     | Clockwise rotation        |
| W     | Activate Thrust           |
| Space | Shoot                     |


## Future Developments
As the game gets more polished i'd like to take the game from an arcade experience to a more complete game experience and implemente the following elements:

1. More complext resource managment (fuel, projectiles, etc.)
2. Different projectile types (Laser, graviton, etc.)
3. Ship upgrades (More thrust, faster turning, more storage)
4. A way to collect resources from the asteroids.

Of course this is not a roadmap but more of a wishlst
